# Coding Challenge - Martian Robots

# How to run
```
//clone repo
npm install
npm start
npm run build
```

# Input Notes
* The user input is looking for a specific format, make sure the last line in the textarea is blank and robots are seperated by a blank line.

# Improvements
* Need to do more testing to make sure there are no edge cases.
* Add cancel subscription to runUserInput in App.js
* Add error handling for user input.
* Add error handling for starting robot off grid.
* Remove bootstrap framework, add's alot of unused CSS.
* Add Unit tests with Jest.
* Re-write userClickBtn in App.js to not use a setTimeout.
